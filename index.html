<h2>
    About
</h2>

<p>
    Brinsley Morrison was born in 2004 and began his musical journey as a chorister 
    for 3 years in Hereford Cathedral. During that time, he sang Bach Passions and 
    Oratorio every year to a full Cathedral. He performed in Buckingham Palace, on 
    BBC Radio 3, and spent a week on tour around America. On top of this, he sang 
    21 hours each week. Although tiring, he felt incredibly rewarded through the 
    passion and emotion everyone around him all put into the music.

    Brinsley went on to join the Chapel and Chamber choirs at the Cathedral School.
    He also played in Herefordshire Youth Orchestra and Hereford Cathedral School 
    Symphony Orchestra, where he played as head violinist in his final year and
    conducted several rehearsals.
    Brinsley went on to study at Chetham’s School of Music 6th Form, where he was 
    taught composition by 
    <a href="https://www.sites.google.com/site/douglasmasoncomposer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Mason</a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.jeremypike.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Pike</a>
    and had vocal tuition from
    <a href="http://www.northernvoices.co.uk/html/helen_francis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helen Francis</a>
    and
    <a href="https://g.co/kgs/U5eVBw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcus Farnsworth</a>.
    Brinsley also studied the violin and piano, and
    achieved his ABRSM Grade 8 before he finished. He played in jazz groups, orchestras, 
    set up a barbershop ensemble, and sang in student-led choirs and the school’s Chamber 
    and contemporary ensemble choir.

    Brinsley has been involved with the BBC several times, from performing on BBC Radio 3, 
    twice as a chorister, once as an 
    <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08mprrw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Easter broadcast from Hereford Cathedral</a>,
    and once again for one of the Three Choirs’ Festival services. 
    Brinsley also became a semi-finalist in the 
    <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08tvn9h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    BBC Young Composer 30 Second Composition Challenge</a>. 
    In Brinsley’s final year at Chethams, he was given the opportunity to sing as a 
    soloist with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra and Chethams’ Chamber ensemble which 
    performed 
    <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0017m61" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Haydn’s Harmoniemesse in The Bridgewater Hall</a>
        and was recorded and later broadcasted on BBC Radio 3.

    During his two years at Chethams, Brinsley learned and performed 26 different pieces onstage 
    of solo vocal repertoire, as well as numerous ensemble pieces. He developed a love of 
    Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms vocal repertoire, and their beautiful Romantic piano and 
    vocal duets. He also loved learning music from unfamiliar genres and styles –also 
    performing songs from 17th Century Italian to modern-day Musical Theatre.
</p>
<p>
    Outside of music, Brinsley was swept away by the sound of the language Japanese that
    he was exposed to through anime. He found it fascinating that the composition of the
    language was so wildly different to English and drawn to its soft and gentle sound.
    Growing up in rural England, he had almost no concept of life or culture on the other
    side of the world. As he discovered and researched more, he became more and more
    interested in the differences between the history, culture, and traditions of the 
    east in comparison to the west. 
</p>
<p>
    Throughout Brinsley’s teens, he self-studied Japanese using textbooks, online resources,
    and films to the point that it became his main pastime. With his interest in Japanese,
    combined with the linguistic tools he learned from his vocal tuition at Chetham’s, his
    passion for languages blossomed and Brinsley’s connection between language and music was
    even further cemented. In his second year, he went on to study Chinese and Japanese music,
    and the differences caused by the unique instruments’ limitations and abilities. In
    Brinsley’s research, he stumbled by 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuAZOvEhQ0M" 
     target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tan Dun’s ‘Buddha Passion’</a>, 
    and was utterly in awe and brought to tears. Tan Dun became a great inspiration in 
    Brinsley’s later orchestral compositions.

    Brinsley also discovered and deeply admired the singer Ian Bostridge for his extremely
    controlled tonal quality in his voice. He became fascinated by the way his voice sounded
    so pure and relaxed, and it consequently became the key focal point for in his own vocal
    technique.
