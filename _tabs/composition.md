# The Brink of the Valley
Performed *29 June 2022* -- in <a href="https://stollerhall.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stoller Hall</a><br> 
by Chetham’s Contemporary Music Ensemble and Chorus, <br>
Brinsley Morrison - Conductor 


I wanted to depict the beautiful view from the top of the valley near where I live in Cornwall. <br>    The piece takes a journey from the beautiful pink setting of the sun as nature goes to sleep, to a night in which warm fires glow. People are merry, singing, dancing and eating to their hearts' content while nature holds the land in a serene stillness.
When writing this, I was influenced by Japanese jazz fusion composers such as Yuji Ohno and Takahiro Obata, who follow Hans Zimmer’s example of fusing technology and classically influenced orchestration with jazz and modal/quartal tonalities from traditional Japanese instruments. I wrote for a similarly large ensemble and didn’t include brass as I didn’t want its metallic timbre. I included harp, marimba and celeste as I also wanted to create an instrumentation based on the standard classical orchestration, but with a greater range of timbres. The large ensemble is partly why I chose to include an electric cello, rather than a regular acoustic. As it dominates the melodic interest, I wanted it to be audible over the other instruments. The choice was also partly inspired from Steve Reich’s integration of electric and acoustic instruments, and wanted to create a similar sound, and my piece is similarly minimalist, with great interest within the texture.

Dormire is an attempt to auditorily depict the mind's contiousness when falling asleep.
This is done through a series of sections and uses quarter-tonality to create an unnerving atmosphere playing with gthe idea of mistaken familiarity which often comes to me in dreams.
The opening phrase depicts the act of falling asleep through a series of descending half major/minor 3rds. It foreshadows the nightmare to come and the spell-like nature of being so tired you just can't help but fall asleep. **UNFINISHED**

Premiered 24 November 2021 in the <a href="https://stollerhall.com/venue-hire/carole-nash-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carole Nash Hall</a><br>

The village in the video is called Geamăna in the north-west of Romania. I first came across the stories of this sunken village through a group of video bloggers’ trip round Romania on YouTube and was intrigued by the beauty of the destruction. All the drone footage you see is a compilation of the shots they took on each of their channels. After compiling these, I researched the history of the village, and edited them together with text explaining the story. I then set about writing a soundtrack, combining sampled instruments, synthesis, and various recordings of my singing All the audio in the track has been manipulated in some form. The orchestral instruments and piano you hear are all sampled, with various effects and plugins used.
The project spanned from January at the start of this year to September, writing it through lockdown and the summer holidays, and the whole process bar the final mixing was done from my laptop in my bedroom at home.

Chetham’s Contemporary Music Ensemble Chorus
Doug Mason - Conductor
The words to my composition; ‘Nageki, Tsutsu’ is written by the Japanese poet 藤原道綱母 (Michitsuna's mother) from the late 900s who’s true name is unknown to history. She wrote about her troubled marriage, and this poem I selected is about her lamentation and loneliness on the nights she sleeps alone waiting until dawn for the nights to be over. I tried experimenting with quartal harmony and traditional Japanese scales and then combining this with 21st century choral writing styles influenced by simplistic tonal composers such as Eric Whitacre and Bob Chillcott.

William Chang - Piano

I wrote this piece to convey three images of spring from my childhood where I lived by the coast in North Devon. The first image shows water dripping down the leaves of the plants in our garden into the pools of water on the stones below. The second image tries to portray the sound of distant waves on the rainy beach down the road, building intensity before my next image; the memory of the first time I saw a storm. The awe and amazement I felt for what was happening outside the little window, covered by a layer of water in the dark of night. Then the rain slowed and got lighter and everything was once again back to as it has been before.
